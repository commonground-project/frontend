# CommonGround Project - Frontend

The repo responsible for the app seen at [commonground.tw](https://commonground.tw)

## Getting Started

This project uses Next.js as the framework, pnpm as the package manager, Playwright for testing, and Husky to run pre-commit checks.

To begin, run `pnpm install` to install all dependencies, then run `pnpm husky init` to initialize husky.

If you wish to run tests, you should install Playwright browsers as well. The browsers can be installed with `npx playwright install`.

Lastly, make a copy of `example.env` and name it `.env`, the fill in all required values.

You have now finished initalizing the project, and can run `pnpm run dev` to start the development server.
